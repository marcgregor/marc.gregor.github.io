# Video Code Review

*The video is too long to be directly posted onto GitHub. However, there is a link to the video at the end of the page*

This code review went over the original three artifacts - the slideshow developed in Java, the binary search tree that held course information, and the SQL customer database. I walk through each of the project's original code and its purpose, as well as the enhancements I planned for each. Peer reviewed code is an additional step in QA, as a fresh set of eyes can often spot something that the developer may have missed.
